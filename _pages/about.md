{% include base_path %}

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University. I mostly participate in research related to natural language processing. Specifically, I have experience in question answering, machine translation, and dialogue state tracking. My other research interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence, privacy, and data science.

I am currently a research assistant in the Human Language Technologies Lab led by [Dr. Shomir Wilson](https://shomir.net/). My research aims to make privacy policies more approachable to the general public. I am working on automatically collecting question-answer pairs from privacy policies and publishing the largest privacy question-answering corpus to date.

I received my M.S. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/departments/EECS-Departments-Computer-Science-Engineering3.aspx) at Pennsylvania State University. I also received my B.S. (magna cum laude) in [Computer Science](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/undergraduate/Computer-Science.aspx) with a minor in [Psychology](https://psych.la.psu.edu/undergraduate/degrees-and-requirements/minor/) at Pennsylvania State University.
